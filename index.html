    <h2>Scratch Projects</h2>
    <p>At the first Inderwick Code club meeting, we used a variety of different coding websites such as:
      <a href="github.com">github,</a>. </p>
    <a href="trinket.com">trinket,</a>

    <p>The second project that we worked on was a Comic strip. The aim of this was to get an understanding of HTML, and using that to make a little comic.</p>
    
    <h2>Github</h2>
    <p> I use <li><a href="github.co.uk">Github</a> to track my work, host my website and for version control.</p><li>
